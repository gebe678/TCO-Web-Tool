# TCO-Web-Tool
A web tool to calculate the total cost of operating of a vehicle

I have included a folder with templates I will continue to add more until we pick a template for the web-tool. So far I have updated the web-tool with the styled drop down menu. I have also updated the dropdown so that it says whatever the user selects from the list in the box. I can update the colors I used for the list and add new elements to them as needed. 

I have finished linking the website to the database and will continue to update the database with more informaiton from the excel sheet. I have also implemented tabs for the detailed view and the simplified view so they are on the same page. I am currently working on adding functionality for the slider menu so it transforms the data like in the excel sheet.
