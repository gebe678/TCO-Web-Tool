# TCO-Web-Tool
A web tool to show the total operating cost of a vehicle

I have included a folder with templates I will continue to add more until we pick a template for the web-tool. So far I have updated the web-tool with the styled drop down menu. I have also updated the dropdown so that it says whatever the user selects from the list in the box. I can update the colors I used for the list and add new elements to them as needed. 

I have completed a possible overlay functionality. The colors go horizontal because I was worried that if the percentage is small enough it might not show up if it were vertical on some of the pictures such as the pickup truck. I can chage the colors to take up a vertical percentage of the image if required.
