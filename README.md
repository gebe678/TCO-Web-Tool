# TCO-Web-Tool
A web tool to calculate the total cost of operating of a vehicle

I have included a folder with templates I will continue to add more until we pick a template for the web-tool. So far I have updated the web-tool with the styled drop down menu. I have also updated the dropdown so that it says whatever the user selects from the list in the box. I can update the colors I used for the list and add new elements to them as needed. 

I am working on adding some slider functionality to the webpage. So far it looks great in chrome, however due to the way different browsers deal with forms I am having trouble getting a streamlined look througout all browsers. Due to this issue I have put the label for the slider on top of the slider rather than to the left of the slider like it was in the example shown in the slides.

I have ran into some trouble getting the image data from canvas in chrome and safari. I have fixed this issue by running the webpage from a localhost server rather than from the desktop filesystem. This is a very simple solution but will only work on my local machine. I believe that this issue will be resolved when the site gets moved to a server. Until then running it from a localhost server will work.
