# TCO-Web-Tool
A web tool to show the total operating cost of a vehicle

I have included a folder with templates I will continue to add more until we pick a template for the web-tool. So far I have updated the web-tool with the styled drop down menu. I have also updated the dropdown so that it says whatever the user selects from the list in the box. I can update the colors I used for the list and add new elements to them as needed. 

I am working on the overlay for the image of the vehicle. One of the problems I have ran into is fitting the color to the image of the car. Currently I have created two different boxes one to contain the car and one over the car. The box that contains the car is colorless but helps position the second box on-top of the car. This second box is then given a half transparent gradient background to achieve different colors. However this approach does not allow for aligning the colors to the graph. 

A second issue I have run into is finding a good picutre that is freely available to use. There are several that can be found on google but I am unsure if I am allowed to use those images freely.
