# TCO-Web-Tool
A web tool to show the total operating cost of a vehicle

I have included a folder with templates I will continue to add more until we pick a template for the web-tool. So far I have updated the web-tool with the styled drop down menu. I have also updated the dropdown so that it says whatever the user selects from the list in the box. I can update the colors I used for the list and add new elements to them as needed. 

I have completed a possible overlay functionality. I was having trouble partitioning the colors vertically but I managed to fix this issue by partitioning them horizontally then rotating the image. I think that this will work as a good solution but it might slow down the site slightly. 

I have ran into some trouble getting the image data from canvas in chrome and safari. I can fix this issue by uploading the picutres to a web-server that allows for sharing with external websites. I am worried that if I implemented this solution than it would not work for other users of the web-tool. I can look for alternate web-servers such as dropbox that can host the images that would not run into problems on other machines.
